## Introduction

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to contribute log samples and their corresponding parser definitions to the Log Samples Repository.

## Preparing Your Log Sample

1. **Name Your Log Sample:** Create a folder with the vendor and product name of the log source.

2. **Structure Your Submission:** Each log sample directory should be placed in its own folder, structured as follows:
    - `raw/`: Contains the sample log files.
    - `definition/`: Contains a JSON file with the parsing definitions.
